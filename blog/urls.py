#We can cll this file anything since we created it, but by convention we call it urls
#Here we will map our view function to our urls

#from django.urs import path
#from . import views

#urlpatterns = path(route:str, view: *args: any, **kwargs: Any)
#so that becomes path("blog/hello", views.say_hello)
